# three-js-game
simple game where we can interact with players using socket.io,three.js and blender

as you open the zip file you will be able to look at both server side scripting and as well as client side code
you should be having node for you to run the server side scripting
npm start in the cd server side code 
or node index.js in the cd server side code
by starting the server now you will be able to run the code with the local host on your computers/desktop
